# CS488 Research

Research work in graphics shaders, done in Unity, under Dr. Salam Daher.

## Usage

Open in Unity, navigate to `Assets/Scenes` and open `3DBased` or `PostProcessing`.

Run the scene and select the GameObject `TuningParameter`. Slide the `Value` slider and see the changes in the viewport.

Feel free to experiment with different combinations of values and presets to see what works best.
